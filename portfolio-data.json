It processes input images to segment the leaf and extracts detailed features (such as GLCM texture, LBP, HOG, and color statistics). These features are then fed into a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, optimized via iterative search, to determine the leaf's health status. The system includes data preprocessing, feature normalization, and robust model evaluation using confusion matrices.",
